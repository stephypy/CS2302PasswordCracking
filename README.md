Purpose: Given a file containing users, salt values, and hashed passwords, create a recursive method 
         that uses brute force to generate all users passwords.

(From lab description):
  *The file is divided as username,salt value, hashed password
  *The passwords only contain numbers (length range is 3-7)
  *Can only have up to two nested loops inside the function
  *Use the provided method [hashlib.sha256()] to find the solution
  *Implementation of test cases
  *This program runs in Python 3.7 (originally coded in pycharm)
